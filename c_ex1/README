our first exercise was to implement discrete convolution in c language,
while applying certain conditions to the input, enabling repeated convolution,
and displaying the output as a histogram.

we were required that the actual convolution will have a runtime complexity
of no more than O(n^2), other than that we had no runtime limitations.

in simple cases, as in short arrays, the implementation of a discrete convolution
is pretty straightforward and simple, just multiplying and adding couples
of numbers from both arrays on different degrees of overlapping, generalizing the
convolution (as we did in this exercise) was a bit hard, but after programming
with concrete values and THEN generalizing them it became clear enough.

besides that, the main challenge was getting comfortable with the syntax,
first time and all.
